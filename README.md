# Spelling-Checker
Spelling checker that will check text for errors and correct it on Kazakh and Russian languages. Also can work on another languages.

In this project i implemented 4 versions of solutions of this 'kind' problem:

1. Bi-directional LSTM using TensorFlow
2. Uni-directional LSTM using Keras
3. Just algorithmic solution using Levenshtein distance
3. Just algorithmic solution using Cosine Similarity distance

This project may be used in search systems in various online markets etc.
